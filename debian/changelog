  * ci: switch test workflow to run in a Debian 13 container
  * Add type annotations to functions/methods, and turn on strict_types.
  * Set time zone to Australia/Perth (configurable via config.inc.php).
  * Use the DateTimeImmutable and DateInterval classes to manage time,
    rather than strings.
  * When payments are received during the "overdue" grace period, start the
    membership from the old expiry date rather than from the payment date.
  * Fix the signup template that was adding a stray '}' to the name field
    on validation failure.
  * Add a ugmm-active-members script that prints the names and emails of
    current and overdue members (i.e. those required to be notified of an
    AGM). This is intended to be synchronised with a mailing list
    membership list.
